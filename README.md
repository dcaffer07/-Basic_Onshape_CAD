### Base
##### Description 
> The Base is the first peice of the caster. It has dementions of 200mm x 120mm and it is 8mm thick.  It has 6 holes all 10mm wide and they are each 20mm from the side and spaces equally. Finally there is a hole that is 25mm in diameter, and is in the center of 4 of the 6 holes on the platform.

##### Reflection
> This was my first OnShape contruction.  I followed along with the video provided (https://youtu.be/93BFUD-HAG8). I learned how to use keyboard shortcuts such as f11 for front, C for cirle, E for Extrude, L for line and many more. This was a great way to ease in to OnShape, i had a blast creating the Base and I look forward to future OnShape constructions.

### Mount
##### Description
> The Mount was even eaiser to construct on OnShape than the base.  The Mount was a a perfect square (120mm x 120mm) that was 8mm thick with 4 holes that were 10mm wide and 20mm from the side and spaced i each corner equally.  Finally it had a bigger whole in the middle with a 25mm diameter that was stationed in the mounts center.

##### Reflection
> This was my second OnShape experience and due to experience i found it easier then the first assighnment. Alike the other contructions i followed along to the video on .5 speed (https://youtu.be/BWDk4BZFXDQ) to make sure i did the assignment correctly.  In this construction i learned how to craete a shape using another shape, in other words i was able to use the base and make the mount by layering the two constructions and than copying my work from the base to the mount.  I also learned how to make patterns and replecate shapes to speed up the contrsuction process. As i continue to get the hang of OnShape i am enjoying it even more and i look forward to seeing how the caster turns out.

### Fork
##### Description
> The Fork was the third part of the caster assignment. This contruction began with a circular platfrom that had a diameter of 80mm and it was 8mm thick. I then created a tube with a outer circle of 20mm diameter and an inner circle of 15mm diameter so the tube was 5m thick, and the tube had a length of 110mm and it had been chamfered at the top.  I then created a shape that was 5mm thick and 166mm long with a hole of a 10mm diameter. I replecated this shape and placed it next to the other symetric from the center of the circular platform.

##### Reflection
>This assignment was probalby the hardest of the three. I kept with my strategy and followed along with the video on .5 speed (https://youtu.be/wQlTfOw8rYQ) to make the constructing easier on myself. In this assignment i continued to work with patterns and i learned how chamfer a shape.  I also learned how to create fillets and make a shape look more realistic.  Finally i made a platform out of a circle for the first time.  I really enjoyed the complexity to this assignment and i look forward to seeing the caster come together.

### Tire
##### Description
>The tire was the 4th part of the caster assembly, and so far and it was most likely the hardest to contruct. The contruction began with a trapazoid that had been made around a contruction line so that it was semetrical,the angle between the botom left and right corners of the trapazod were contstructed 10 degress from the construction y-axis line on each side so that the shape was symetrical to itslef and to the y-axis.  Next, because this initial trapziodal shape will eventually turn into a weel, we gave the shape an outer diameter of 110, and an inner diameter of 80. I then resolved the shape around the sketch 1 dieameter constrction lines and put 8mm fillets to both top edges.  Finally i had to change the color to gray.

##### Reflection
>This assignment was difficult, however i enjoyed contrcting it a lot. Like the other assignments i followed along to the video that was done by one of the other engineering teachers at .5 speed, i am still getting the hang of OnShape however i shold be good to start contructinh withot the videos(https://youtu.be/ReEGioIYSus). In this assignment i leaned how to draw a shape, and with the revelve function evelve it around an axis. I also learned how the different diameters of a shape effect its positioning, for example the inner and outer diamter that revelve for the tire.  Finally i learned how to change the constructions color(gray). I look forward to more constrctions to come.

### Wheel
##### Description
>This construction was withot a doubt the most complicated of the 4 before it, however this was probalby my favorite thing to construct.  I began this constrction by making three connected rectangles that were each symetric to a contrction line, the top rectangle had demensions of 5mm x 20mm and the others were measured through the creation of inner and outer diameter lines around different axis( inner diameter was 80 and outer were 10 and 25).  From there i revolved each of the three connected rectangle faces arond the x-axis and then extruded a shape through the tire through with lines i drew.  I then made a circular pattern around the face 1 of the tire 5x and i then had 5 cuttouts in my tire. Finally i put a 1mm fillet around all of the edges on the front and the back of the tire.

##### Reflection
>At this point i can't wait to see how the caster turns out. For this assignment I did a mixture of following alond with the given video(https://youtu.be/RKeALFyqSGw) and i looked at the given images to see what to do, as i am now comfortable enough with OnShape that i can construct the things on my own. I learned how to revolve multiple shapes at the same time by just clicking the different faces.  I also learned how to create a circular pattern and how to use the "see edges through shape" function to tap on lines without baing able to see them.  I am really starting to get the hang of OnShape, and as i said i can't wait to see how the caster turns out.
