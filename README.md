##### Reflection
> This was my first OnShape contruction.  I followed along with the video provided (https://youtu.be/93BFUD-HAG8). I learned how to use keyboard shortcuts such as f11 for front, C for cirle, E for Extrude, L for line and many more. This was a great way to ease in to OnShape, i had a blast creating the Base and I look forward to future OnShape constructions.
